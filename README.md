#CALORIE_TRACKER

This project is designed to develop a data-driven Calorie Tracker system that enables users to monitor their daily food intake and evaluate it against their personal health goals. The primary aim is to provide a structured and user-friendly tool that not only records what the user consumes but also breaks down the nutritional components of each meal, including calories, carbohydrates, proteins, and fats.

Users can log their meals either manually or through a structured dataset. The system processes this data to calculate total daily calorie consumption and compare it with the userâ€™s recommended calorie goal, which is determined using factors such as age, weight, height, activity level, and fitness objectives (e.g., weight loss, maintenance, or gain).

By visualizing this information through charts and summaries, users gain actionable insights into their eating patterns. The system highlights imbalances in nutrient intake and suggests improvements based on general dietary guidelines. This promotes healthy eating habits and supports informed decision-making.

Built using Python with libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib, the project may also be extended to Power BI for interactive dashboarding. Ultimately, the tracker helps users stay on top of their health journey while applying key data analytics skills in a real-world context.
